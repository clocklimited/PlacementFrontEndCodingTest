  <!-- Bulbasaur
  When the bulb on its back grows large, it appears to lose the ability to stand on its hind legs.
  Charmander
  It has a preference for hot things. When it rains, steam is said to spout from the tip of its tail.
  Squirtle
  When it retracts its long neck into its shell, it squirts out water with vigorous force. -->
