Your finished solution should:

- Accurately represent the attached screenshot of the finished solution
- Incorporate Responsive Web Design

In addition to this, you should answer the following questions:

- What measures could you take to ensure this page is fully accessible?
- Would you make any changes to the page if you needed to display all 151 original Pokémon? If so, what are they and why would you make them?
- Any other considerations?
